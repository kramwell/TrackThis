 20/AUG/2017 - Built to be an extremely fast and efficient ticket management system based around ease of access and quick response times.

Project discontinued due to lack of funding.

Overview
> User logs ticket and chooses relevant department, email sent to user with ticket number.
> Email is sent to technician(s) assigned to group
> Technicians can agree/disagree/return the ticket
> If all tickets have been denied or not responded in appropriate amount of time then an email is sent and call is put into central queue for resolution, reminder sent out.

> Daily emails sent to each technician outlining work still in progress
> Users can check ticket status and request an update
> Helpdesk can login and check queue- reassign as necessary. Add users, create tickets, see overdue work orders etc.
> Advanced options for managers such as kpi reporting, tickets closed per month etc.
